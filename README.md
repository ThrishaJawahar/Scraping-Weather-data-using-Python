Scraping-weather-data-using-Python to get umbrella reminder on email Built a Python application that scrapes weather data and sends email reminders based on specific conditions. Using requests and BeautifulSoup, this script extracts weather information from Google. If the forecast predicts rain or clouds, an "umbrella reminder" is sent to your email, ensuring you never forget to pack an umbrella before heading out. The application leverages smtplib for email notifications and schedule to run daily at a specified time. This project showcases the practical use of Python for integrating web scraping, email automation, and scheduling to keep you prepared for the weather.
